0.3.0 alpha 1

        Update Information:

        Due to the new station list format you will have to rebuild your
        station selections for the quickbar and the docking menu. The
        stations should be read without problems. As soon as you quit
        kradio and the configuration files are written, any versions 0.2.x
        will not be able to read the station list and configuration files.

                * alarms are now in ~/<dot-kdedir>/share/config/kradiorc, ~/.kradiorc is read for compatibility

                * I'd like to provide ready-to-use-kradio preset files within the dist.
                  I'd be pleased if you like to contribute your personal preset file to this project.
