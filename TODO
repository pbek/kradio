                  not notice power state changes, etc...

FUTURE
======
  * just grep for FIXME and TODO...


USABILITY, STYLE-GUIDE
======================
  * /tmp/kradio* should use offical KDE tmpdir instead // really necessary? it is configurable
  * still applicable for kde4? more use of KStdGuiItem
  * sort out the KDE hicolor / crystal / SVG icon mess
  * Buildsystem: manpage generation
  * Buildsystem: apidocs
  * KDE uses l10n instead of i18n now
  * Autohell: configure checks for dependency libs, pkg-config

DISTRIBUTION
============
  * Get svn2dist (used for kdeextragear) to work with KRadio. This will
    give us nice kradio.src.gz tarballs.
  * apps.kde.org ?!?!
  * dot.kde.org ????
