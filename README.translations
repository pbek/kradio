Just some very short notes/steps how to create
a KRadio4 translation:

 1) cd to kradio4 base directory
 2) run ./extract-messages.sh
 3) run ./merge-messages.sh
 4) use the created .pot files for translation
    (they are located in the po/ directories, one for each plugin)
 5) Please send me the <lang>.po files while 
    keeping the structure of plugin-wise .po/.pot files/directories

Thanks for your translation!
