This UML Diagram does not reflect the current state of the application,
but it collects ideas for a restructuring to solve some Problems.

It was created with Umbrello (CVS Version > 20.03.2003), which will be part of
kdesdk in KDE 3.2 .

------
The following problems are addressed:
- Nowerdays Radio Stations often come as Internet Streams, those should be
  supported
- The implementation of Radio Devices (i.e. either V4L Hardware-Radio or
  Internet Radio) must not be exclusive, but live next to each other
- Internet Radio Stations and Hardware Radio Stations differ and are bound to
  one Radio Device Implementation 
- The specifics of the Radio Device should be hidden as much as possible,
  without removing functionality from the GUI.
