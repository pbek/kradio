This is a small radio application for kde 2/3 with lirc support
You can get the latest version from

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/kradio/

------------------
Compile CVS tree
------------------

First checkout kradio from CVS and do in ./

  make -f Makefile.dist
  ./configure
  make
  make install


------------------
KDE3
------------------

To compile KRadio against KDE3 you have to perform a 

  cvs update -r KDE3

within your ./admin directory after cvs checkout. After that kradio
should compile without problems for KDE3.


------------------
Configuration
------------------

At the current state, most configuration options for are only
accessible by your kradiorc file, usually found in
~/.kde/share/config/kradiorc or /etc/kde2/kradiorc, etc.  An example
configuration file can be found in ./kradio/kradiorc.example.

CVS-NOTE: 

At the moment, there is another configuration file that contains
station and alarm configuration in an xml format. That file should be
~/.kradiorc . An example can be found in
./kradio/dot-kradiorc.example. Please note, that the configuration
file format and/or concept may change in future.


------------------
lirc support
------------------

lirc support is realized by the lirc_client lib. It should be detected
automatically by ./configure. This library is used to translate the
remote control key names to names used by kradio, and may additionally
be used for state management (tv, etc).  An example for an apropriate
.lircrc file can be found in ./kradio/dot-lircrc.example.
