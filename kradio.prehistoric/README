------------------
Configuration
------------------

At the current state, most configuration options for are only accessible by your
kradiorc file, usually found in ~/.kde/share/config/kradiorc or /etc/kde2/kradiorc, etc.
An example configuration file can be found in ./kradio/kradiorc.example.

------------------
lirc support
------------------

lirc support is realized by the lirc_client lib. It should be detected automatically
by ./configure. This library is used to translate the remote control key names to
names used by kradio, and may additionally be used for state management (tv, etc).
An example for an apropriate .lircrc file can be found in ./kradio/dot-lircrc.example.
