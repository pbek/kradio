------------------
lirc support
------------------

lirc support is realized by the lirc_client lib. It should be detected
automatically by ./configure. This library is used to translate the
remote control key names to names used by kradio, and may additionally
be used for state management (tv, etc).  An example for an apropriate
.lircrc file can be found in ./kradio/dot-lircrc.example.

Names used by kradio:

   TV         powerOff, give tv program a chance
   0..9       numerical station selection
   CH+        frequency increment
   CH-        frequency decrement
   VOL+       volume increment
   VOL-       volume decrement
   CH-SEARCH  beachward station search
