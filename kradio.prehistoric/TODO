short-term:
* better Icon for QuickBar Button
* fix sticky behavior on "window-close/restore" (both kradio & quickbar)
* make use of ~/.kde/share/apps/kradio/... concept
* beautify quickbar buttons (horrible alignments...)

// * use session management for saving of options (currently options are not saved on quit, because application->quit is called instead of window->close)
// session management only works on kde-exit, not program-exit :(

next release:
* some graphical configuration dialog(s) for
  - station quick select
  - alarm functions
  - station management
  - device settings
* collect location information for cannel sets

future:
* recording capabilities
* quick radio applet
* DCOP Interface
* mediacontrol applect integration

DONE:
// * kde3 port //kalass
// * replace StationButton by ordinary buttons // completely removed - kalass
// * use kde menus (emw, long time ago)
// * QuickBar (emw)
// * xml based station configuration (klas)
