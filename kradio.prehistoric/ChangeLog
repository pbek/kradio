0.3.0 alpha 1

        Update Information:

        Due to the new station list format you will have to rebuild your
        station selections for the quickbar and the docking menu. The
        stations should be read without problems. As soon as you quit
        kradio and the configuration files are written, any versions 0.2.x
        will not be able to read the station list and configuration files.

        BACKUP YOUR CONFIGURATION FILES!        

        emw     - major rewrite (interfaces, plugins, ...)
                - AM/FM readyness

                - use frequency instead of (changable) stationID for alarms
                - implement a "contribute preset file to kradio project" function via KDE standard mail client

                - sleep countdown function, countdown stopped by poweron/off, accessible via lirc/docking menu
                - make kradioapp responsible for lircHelper
                - make use of <KDEDIR>/share/apps/kradio/presets possible
                - include first station preset file in dist (germany/aachen-cable.krp, still a bit incomplete;)

        kalass  - fixed config autosave bug

                Release notes:
                * ~/.kradiorc is still read for compatibility, but only if ~/<dot-kdedir>/share/data/kradio/stations.krp does not exist/contain valid data
                * alarms are now in ~/<dot-kdedir>/share/config/kradiorc, ~/.kradiorc is read for compatibility

                * I'd like to provide ready-to-use-kradio preset files within the dist.
                  I'd be pleased if you like to contribute your personal preset file to this project.
