0.2.7   emw     - added pseudo lirc key "QUIT"
				- fixed some more quickbar bugs
				- make "good signal" level configurable, sometimes autoscan did not find all stations

0.2.6   emw     - activate station in setupdialog by freq, not stationId
                - add "unknown station" to kradio->cbStations
                - fix alarm inconsistencies
                - make alarm management independent from radiobase: new class TimeControl
                - make xml-config independent from radiobase: kradioapp is now responsible for it

                - sleep countdown function, countdown stopped by poweron/off, accessible via lirc/docking menu
                - make kradioapp responsible for lircHelper
                - fixed config autosave bug
                - make use of <KDEDIR>/share/apps/kradio/presets possible
                - include first station preset file in dist (germany/aachen-cable.krp, still a bit incomplete;)

                Release notes:
                * ~/.kradiorc is still read for compatibility, but only if ~/<dot-kdedir>/share/data/kradio/stations.krp does not exist/contain valid data
                * alarms are now in ~/<dot-kdedir>/share/config/kradiorc, ~/.kradiorc is read for compatibility

                * I'd like to provide ready-to-use-kradio preset files within the dist.
                  I'd be pleased if you like to contribute your personal preset file to this project.
