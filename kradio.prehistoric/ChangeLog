                Release notes:
                * ~/.kradiorc is still read for compatibility, but only if ~/<dot-kdedir>/share/data/kradio/stations.krp does not exist/contain valid data
                * alarms are now in ~/<dot-kdedir>/share/config/kradiorc, ~/.kradiorc is read for compatibility

                * I'd like to provide ready-to-use-kradio preset files within the dist.
                  I'd be pleased if you like to contribute your personal preset file to this project.
